Market Definition/Description
</span>
</h2>
<div class="clearme"></div>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-425348497">
The software test automation market offers tools, technologies, components and services that together constitute the critical elements of automated testing. It includes tools for performing static code analysis, functional testing, and load and performance testing in an automated way.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-800675361">
This Magic Quadrant focuses on functional software test automation tools. These tools enable an organization to design, develop, maintain, manage, execute and analyze automated functional tests for applications running on different platforms (including desktop, web, mobile and server). They can run automated functional tests by driving the user interface (UI) of an application (known as UI test automation), or interact with the application through an application programming interface (API test automation).
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-170624301">
Test automation tools are fundamental to achieving the continuous testing approach required by DevOps. Continuous testing is the process of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline, to obtain immediate feedback on the business risks associated with a software release candidate. It requires the ability to integrate with and leverage different environments, including but not limited to development, continuous integration (CI), quality assurance (QA), preproduction, performance testing, staging and even production (e.g., by leveraging production monitoring).
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-456170405">
The software test automation market consists of independent vendors and test automation products that are part of larger vendors' portfolios or solutions. Clients can purchase any test automation product as a stand-alone offering. Some products have many optional and related components and most offer &quot;free for evaluation&quot; or open-source tools, which can make up a significant percentage of a vendor's user base. We also note that many testing service providers have a test automation offering (see

<span class="annotate" id="a920245045">
&quot;Magic Quadrant for Application Testing Services, Worldwide&quot;
</span>
</a>
<span class="annotate" id="a-641699785">
); however, these are generally not offered independently of services.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-1815765469">
Over the years, a number of independent vendors in this space have been acquired by larger vendors, which demonstrates the criticality of automated testing in many enterprise systems. However, there are still dozens of independent vendors, as well as new vendors entering the market and established vendors transforming their products to offer enhanced test automation capabilities. Gartner expects the test automation space to continue to evolve rapidly; wearables, bots and conversational UI channels need to be folded into the omnichannel approach of modern applications, and the increased adoption of DevOps demands higher levels of automation. This will further increase the need for automated testing across a broad range of platforms and technologies.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-1472646165">
Open source continues to have a strong impact upon the market. Currently, open-source solutions are mainly oriented toward developers and focused on web and mobile technologies, making them somewhat specialized and not appropriate for all testing needs. We expect that most organizations will utilize more than one solution for the next five years. We also expect that open source will be a core element of a growing amount of cloud-delivered test automation services.

CA Technologies
</span>
</h4>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-346871615">
CA Technologies is in the Visionaries quadrant based on its vision for DevOps, shift-left testing and continuous testing. Its automated testing portfolio has evolved to address the different phases of software delivery, including plan, build, test, release and operate, and it supports agile and lean development practices.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a820097368">
CA's test automation offering consists of several products, including CA Agile Requirements Designer for test design and generation, CA Service Virtualization (SV)/Application Test for on-premises test execution, and CA BlazeMeter for SaaS-based testing. There is an integration with CA Test Data Manager for creating and provisioning test data. Test cases can be generated with a visual modeling paradigm using different path options, a risk-based approach or by recording live scenarios. By default the generated test cases are manual. However, test scripts can be generated using configuration files and code snippets for different execution engines, such as CA Application Test, Selenium, Ranorex or Testplant, as well as the Taurus open-source testing framework. There are integrations with CI tools such as Jenkins and CA Continuous Delivery Director, which orchestrates continuous testing and delivery.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a271771800">
CA offers test automation using a framework-driven paradigm. It supports testing for a wide range of technologies, including desktop, web and mobile, with either CA Application Test or by generating automation scripts for supported automation tools and open-source frameworks.

IBM
</span>
</h4>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a1263879349">
IBM is in the Challengers quadrant, with a good ability to execute and support enterprise customers but a slower pace of innovation than the Visionaries and Leaders exhibit. In 2016, IBM partnered with HCL Technologies for development and maintenance of its Rational product line, allowing IBM to invest in emerging cloud-native and cognitive solutions.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a1134229823">
IBM's Rational Test Workbench (RTW) test automation offering is a test platform that supports a wide range of scenarios, including API testing, functional UI testing and service virtualization. Following a record/enhance/execute paradigm, RTW offers scripting options for Visual Basic .NET and Java, and a natural-language test representation with visual editing. For UI testing of mobile and web applications, test steps, data substitutions and verification points can be created from interactive application screenshots. RTW integrates with IBM's UrbanCode platform as well as other CI tools such as Jenkins. Test assets can be versioned from any part of RTW into version control systems such as Git or IBM Rational Team Concert.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a1570857803">
RTW automates functional tests for traditional Windows, Java or .NET, web and mobile applications, and the mainframe. It also enables API testing and can be combined with Rational Test Virtualization Server for service virtualization. IBM does not provide its own support for managing and testing mobile devices; this instead comes through partnerships with Bitbar and Perfecto Mobile.

Leaders represent a strong combination of Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision. They have established strong market positions, as shown by breadth of adoption, global deployments and integration of other products. Leaders have been successful in building a loyal customer base, and show strong revenue growth and/or high market share. They also have a good vision of the needs of the enterprise, support for open source and standards, a solid understanding of IT requirements, and scalable channels and partnerships. They generally have breadth across a significant number of supported technologies and platforms, and deliver market-leading functionality in one or more functional areas. Leaders must provide solutions that are easy to purchase, use, manage and upgrade, and which can connect to a range of complementary systems â€” from both the same vendor and third parties

Challengers in this market have high numbers of satisfied enterprise clients, a large and growing base of seats in deployment, and the ability to meet the needs of multiple departments in global rollouts. Challengers are vendors with a history of execution in the broad market, but they may not yet have accumulated a substantial track record in the test automation market across a range of scenarios. Vendors in this quadrant typically have strong execution capabilities, as evidenced by financial resources, and a significant sales and brand presence garnered from the company as a whole, if not directly from test-automation-related activities. They tend to have well-established partnerships and a solid global presence. In general, Challengers may have been innovators at one point, but are not seen as driving the application development market. Challengers may also lack a cohesive technical or business vision â€” or may have lingering product gaps or inconsistent or incomplete strategies in their product roadmaps

They are not as strong in one or more of the following criteria: product breadth/completeness or focus, geography or number of customers. Although they may be a good choice for a particular departmental, regional or industry use case, they are typically not well-suited as a broad platform for use across an enterprise. In addition, vendors in this quadrant may have a much more limited ability to invest in the necessary functional as well as organizational capabilities to expand beyond their current focus. Nevertheless, for specific scenarios, an offering from a Niche Player may represent the optimal choice. In some cases, these vendors may be more mature and able to support customers than some of the Visionary providers.

The 2017 Magic Quadrant has evolved to meet the challenges and changing needs of enterprises that embrace DevOps and continuous testing. As DevOps principles gain significant traction in enterprises, testing and QA is no longer a stage in delivery but an integral DevOps activity that exists in various forms through all areas.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a1806306312">
Automation has become an indispensable element in these efforts, and there has been renewed focus on software test automation tools as part of a larger toolchain that enables DevOps. This includes static code analysis and unit tests, but will also include functional test automation at the UI layer and API layer, as well as service virtualization and performance tests that run with every build and are kicked off via CI tools.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a769146542">
It is important to note that automation isn't just a matter of being able to quickly create a set of automated test scripts; it is about being able to create a set of effective tests that can be maintained with minimal effort and executed without any human intervention, as part of a DevOps toolchain. Maintaining healthy and relevant sets of automated tests over time is one of the biggest challenges in test automation. Often, the time saved executing tests automatically is outweighed by the time spent updating them. Successful test automation must also include the automated design of test cases â€” for example, based on a model of the application or a set of requirements as well as automatic generation of relevant test data. Ultimately, tests must demonstrate that applications not only work, but satisfy real business requirements.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a508584134">
The theme of this year's Magic Quadrant is continuous testing, and the focus has shifted. We evaluated vendors that offer test automation solutions with strong support for organizations with a high percentage of custom application development, and with a need to support continuous automated testing as part of a DevOps delivery pipeline. Such offerings include the ability to leverage open-source testing frameworks and tools as well as increase tester productivity through added-value features. They provide UI test automation, API test automation capabilities, or both. They can simplify testing across all layers of an application (GUI, API and data).
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a1901419570">
As we focused on these custom development scenarios, we did not evaluate vendors that primarily focused on packaged application testing scenarios. These are different to most custom-made software, as organizations have a stronger focus on validation of business process, integration points and performance.

The state of the test automation market in 2017 again demonstrates the continued volatility of test automation technologies. It also points to the growing maturation of the market, as the bar continues to be raised. Strong go-to-market strategies combined with strong visions for next-generation automation technologies proved to be the winning formula for those in the Leaders and Visionaries quadrants. The Challengers and Niche Players quadrants represent a good mix of vendors that fine-tune their test automation strategies and offerings, often as part of larger product portfolios.

<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a826053912">
As with any fast-changing market, simply shortlisting vendors from the Leaders quadrant does not guarantee success. IT leaders need to work with their LOB stakeholders to identify the best solution, based on specific use cases, skill sets and resources, as well as the DevOps-readiness of the enterprise business applications, IT architecture and infrastructure.

The test automation market landscape is vast and diverse, and includes many vendors with different specialization. Gartner is aware of more than 100 vendors offering test automation solutions globally, but these vendors do not represent the complete marketplace. The nine vendors evaluated in this Magic Quadrant represent only a small number of vendors capable of supporting enterprise customers. Be aware that many smaller vendors not covered in this Magic Quadrant may be appropriate for your particular needs.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-1267687387">
Gartner uses inclusion criteria to identify global vendors that can handle complex, transformational projects in large enterprises, but there are many vendors with focused technologies (e.g., support for COTS) that may be more appropriate. When selecting tools, it is key to understand the specific use cases as well as skill sets, practices and operational models. Because of the diversity of technologies to test, and as organizations become bimodal, teams should also expect to have more than one automation tool in place. Clients are advised to speak to the authors of this Magic Quadrant to narrow down a shortlist of best-fit vendors in this study as well as to discuss providers not covered here.

Market Overview
</span>
</h2>
<div class="clearme"></div>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-1828762917">
Demand for test automation continues to grow, driven by time-to-market considerations and increasingly complex applications having become the driver of a digital business. Organizations must find ways to achieve a higher rate of automation and support shifts to agile and DevOps practices. Continuous delivery (CD) practices rely on a fully automated delivery pipeline, including automated functional testing as well as code quality, security and performance testing. Together with new opportunities created by a shift to cloud-based solutions, this is creating a vibrant market â€” many new products entering the space, acquisitions, and innovation from existing vendors.

During the course of producing this research, the Micro Focus and heritage HPE Software spin-merge finalized on 1 September 2017. The transaction was announced a year earlier on 7 September 2016 and caused speculations about its market impact (see

</span>
</a>
<span class="annotate" id="a-849566137">
). It also opened a window of opportunity for competitors eager to take market share. While the transaction has now closed, we expect the reverberations to continue disrupting the market. HPE was the dominant force in this market for many years, and has now exited the market; Micro Focus now needs to define and communicate its go-forward strategy.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a1129266401">
We expect that the market will remain very dynamic, creating opportunities for vendors over the next 12 to 18 months as significant investment capital continues to flow and commercial providers expand portfolios to better support agile and DevOps best practices. Vendors will look to position themselves in the digital business marketplace, further consolidate market share or build a solid maintenance revenue pipeline. There will continue to be a steady influx of new, innovative vendors that don't need to deal with legacy heritage and can take advantage of open-source building blocks, quickly building a modern and user-friendly portfolio of products that appeal to agile developers. The majority of these vendors are still in the startup phase, with little revenue and limited customer bases. However, we expect that many of them will be useful additions to the portfolios of some of the larger vendors that have gaps in their offerings. We also continue to see increased efforts from testing service firms to produce tools, and we expect testing service providers to have a higher impact on the overall market due to the level of use and growth of test outsourcing.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a979459299">
Open source continues to have a galvanizing effect on the market. In many cases, it has provided a level of &quot;standardization&quot; that has been well-adopted by organizations practicing agile development and making use of CI/CD practices. Open-source offerings are increasingly replacing the more traditional ALM-driven execution of tests with the automated execution of tests, as part of a CI/CD process. Testing is evolving to a mentality of using the tools that work best for the team; and rather than use a monolithic tool, developers are using a combination of open-source and commercial tools to perform the various testing activities â€” for example:
</span>
</p>
<ul class="bullets-yes">
<li>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-959810366">
Selenium has emerged as the de facto standard for web testing, and a large ecosystem has developed around it.
</span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-2031950628">
Appium is also gaining a lot of momentum as one of the most popular open-source, cross-platform mobile automation frameworks for executing tests on iOS and Android, as well as Windows desktop.
</span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-1844017771">
BDD frameworks such as SpecFlow, Cucumber and JBehave, along with the Gherkin language, are getting adopted by many agile development organizations. Test automation vendors are including support for such frameworks.
</span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a-2007907470">
Other open-source tools and frameworks have also gained momentum, including Geb, SoapUI, Sahi, Watir, Protractor, Bugzilla and Apache JMeter â€” and the number is growing.
</span>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a1659227517">
Open source is also one of the key factors that is increasingly dividing the market. Many tools are targeting the developer and technical tester. They integrate well with the overall development tool stack and offer a code-based approach to developing test scripts. However, these tools are less-suited for nondevelopers. Subject matter experts and business analysts who are contributing to test automation efforts are looking for options that either hide or remove coding completely. We expect that the majority of organizations will find themselves using a number of tools from different providers (or open source) rather than having a single vendor to solve all problems. As an integral part of a DevOps toolchain, test automation solutions are continuing to evolve rapidly beyond being just silos for the development of automated tests by dedicated testers. Leading solutions enable multiple user types to contribute to building automated tests for multiple test targets and foster collaboration in the greater team in the same tool.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a1284129366">
To achieve this metamorphosis, you must address three important principles with your test automation tools:
</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<b>
<span class="annotate" id="a217914069">
Decouple test development methodology and technology.
</span>
</b>
<span class="annotate" id="a-1957320374">
Use cases across an enterprise are very diverse. Test automation functionality must be exposed in different front ends, frameworks and IDEs that are tailored to specific app use cases and user roles.
</span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>
<span class="annotate" id="a-2120693609">
Embrace open source and standards.
</span>
</b>
<span class="annotate" id="a1474780570">
The adoption of open-source solutions for testing is accelerating and organizations are aiming to lower the risk of vendor lock-in. Test automation tools must therefore integrate with open-source tools and support testing frameworks, such as Selenium, Appium or SoapUI.
</span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>
<span class="annotate" id="a-437991917">
Enable self-service development.
</span>
</b>
<span class="annotate" id="a784263422">
Test automation development is increasingly initiated and supported by constituents outside IT. Test automation solutions must enable a self-service mode of development and provide visual or model-driven paradigms for citizen testers, such as business analysts, LOB professionals and marketing professionals.
</span>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<span class="annotate" id="a109904347">
Over the next five years, we expect that machine learning and predictive analytics will play an increasing role in software testing and automation. We are beginning to see early signs of this primarily in research or in focused domains. It is likely that packaged applications as well as test planning and management will be the first areas that have success here. There will be an outgrowth of tools designed around robotic process automation (RPA) and business process extraction to automatically derive test automation, as well as around using predictive analytics to focus testing efforts.

Most vendors &quot;support&quot; testing of packaged application software to the extent that they can drive the UI of the front end â€” that is, if the client front end is a native Windows or web application, it is &quot;just another application&quot; that can be automated in the same way as others built on that technology.
